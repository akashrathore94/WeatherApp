Brief info

The openweather api was not working as my key was ot authenticated
so i created a small dummy data array wuth three elements

so if you search delhi, lahore or berlin you get the data from the dummy data list
The person who joined the call suggested to create a dummy data instead of waiting for my key to be activated

so if you search for delhi, berlin or lahore you get the response
else you get an alert stating city not found
i have added search functionaly both on search button and pressing enter while typing in the input
used apexChart api for displaying chart

using initial state with noida as city and some dummy data
would have used browser location if the api would have been working

have used react router for routing
history page shows all the successsful searched cities with their temp and the time you searched on as well as the day you searched on

could have customised the chart as per the screenshot provied as well, if i had half an hour more
have worked with chartjs on various projects earlier in vanilla js, thats why aware of the customisations
